# Password Generator Starter Code

What the user wants:
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

Description: 
*I started by defining the generate password button.
*I created the first prompt (length) that pops up when the element is generated by the button click.
*It has limitations that if something is entered incorrectly it will send an error alert to let the user know they inserted an invalid entry.
*I added the confirm options for all uppercase, lowercase, and symbols to be used in the password.
*I then made sure when the option was okay or cancel that the option the user selected was the action that followed in generating the password.
*I validated the input so the password would generate accordingly to the prompts selected.
